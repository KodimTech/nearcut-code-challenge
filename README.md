### SUMMARY
The project was created from zero, no boilerplate was used, with the purpose of showing my skills with Ruby on Rails.

It was developed using good practices learned overtime by working on different teams and projects, it covers:
- **Basic Rails**: Basic rails day to day.
- **StimulusJS**: For handling the front-end logic.
- **Turbo**: For handling TURBO_STREAM responses and front-end actions.
- **Clean Code**: The code is clean and easy to read.
- **Design Patterns**: The code is implemented using the Strategy Pattern.
- **Unit Testing**: The code is covered by unit tests.

It also uses some gems that I found useful for a project with this characteristics:
- **activerecord-import**: For bulk insertions.
- **csv**: For reading and writing csv files.
- **faker**: For creating fake data.
- **view_component**: For creating reusable components.
- **bcrypt**: For encrypting passwords.
- **dotenv-rails**: For managing environment variables.
- **factory_bot_rails**: For creating test data.
- **rspec**: For testing.
- **shoulda-matchers**: For testing.
- **database_cleaner**: For testing.
- **simplecov**: For testing coverage.

On the repository you will find all the pull requests made for each feature developed, github follows CI practices as you will find on
the actions tab and .github folder on the project files.

Deployment was made to Fly.io and the project is available at: [https://rails-challenge-2021-1.fly.dev/](https://code-challenge-wandering-shape-9483.fly.dev/)

Continuous deployment was set up using the Fly.io GitHub Action but it does not trigger automatically, didn't find it necessary for this project,
but it's part of my stack knowledge.

No css library was used, as you didn't mention on your job description, I decided to use a example on codepen to make it look a little bit better.

It was a pleasure to work on this challenge, I hope you enjoy it.
